How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, MongoDB, Express

With this app first you input you name and press submit that triggers a click function that logs the users name to the database. Then the user can play the game. The user can press either heads or tails which triggers click function that compares assigned values to heads and tails to a random number between 0 and 1 and if they match you win and if they dont they use. After that the result in pinned to the DOM. Then the user and press thumbs up or thumbs down to tally you win lose scores.

Optimizations
If I get a chance to go back to this I want to make it so that the app and log the player and the computers scores automatically so that the user doesnt have to do it themselves.

Lessons Learned:
I leaned how to manipulate the templete to be able to keep track of numbers in my data base.
